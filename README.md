I have only used css to style this.

I implemented the admin side to add , edit , delete and view books. becaue I misread the document.
use this link to view it: http://localhost:3000/adminHome

I have implemented the customer side to view existing books , rate and review them , edit and delete their reviews.
http://localhost:3000/customerHome

average rating will be calculated in the backend.
see the backend/service folder to see the logic of calculating the average rating.

to login as a customer use email: sahan@gmail.com and password:sahan
